# ZSH Vibecoded Shortcuts

Custom ZSH functions for terminal productivity.

## Structure

- `functions.zsh` - All custom shell functions

## Adding New Functions

1. Add the function to `functions.zsh`
2. Update README.md with usage docs
3. Commit and push

## Conventions

- Functions should be self-contained
- Include usage help when arguments are missing
- Use local variables to avoid polluting global scope
